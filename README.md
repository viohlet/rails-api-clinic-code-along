# Rails API single Code Along

## Prerequisites

-   Ruby

## Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:

-   Explain why a back-end is necessary.
-   List some of the responsibilities of a typical back-end, and identify which
components within (R)MVC map to those responsibilities.
-   Map (R)MVC roles to specific components of Rails.
-   Indicate where different types of files can be found within a Rails
application.
-   Bear witness to the creation of an API.

## Preparation

1.  [Fork and clone](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone)
    this repository.
1.  Create a new branch, `training`, for your work.
1.  Install dependencies with `bundle install`
1.  Once dependencies have finished installing open your rails server in another
terminal tab with `rails server`.

## Dependencies

-   [`rails-api`](https://github.com/rails-api/rails-api)
-   [`rails`](https://github.com/rails/rails)
-   [`active_model_serializers`](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers)
-   [`ruby`](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
-   [`postgres`](http://www.postgresql.org)

# Rails API Code Along

## Status Check

These will be frequent. As developers we want to be meticulous and make sure
we're getting errors where expected as we build our API.

-  Navigate to `localhost:3000` in chrome.
  - We should get an internal server error in our browser.
  - We should also see some error message in your tab that is running our rails server.
  - __Looks like we're missing secrets. Let's follow the error messages to correct our errors__

## Add Secrets

-  Open `config/secrets.yml`
-  Follow the instructions in that file to set a **different** key for `development` and `test`.
-  *Do not touch `production`*
-  Now that we have our secrets run `rake db:nuke_pave`.
  - This rake command `nuke_pave` is one of many, this one deletes all database
    instances, creates a new one, and loads starting data (if any).
-  Quit your server and restart it.
-  *Did that not work? Are you running a database like postgres?*

## Status Check

-  Navigate to `localhost:3000` in chrome.
  -  Do you get a `welcome aboard` page?
  -  Check your server, are there any error messages?


## Routing

We're making a clinic API Right? Let's try checking to see if there are any
patients by navigating to `localhost:3000/patients`

You should get an error similar to the following:

```bash
Routing Error
No route matches [GET] "/patients"
```

Whoops! We haven't made any routes yet!

As you learned in the previous lesson,
a route indicates which controller action will be triggered
when a particular type of HTTP request arrives at a given URL.

In order for our API to respond to GET requests at the `/patients` URL,
we'll need to create a Route that specifies what to do
when that type of request comes in.

Add the following code to `config/routes.rb`:

```ruby
get '/patients', to: 'patients#index'
```

This tells Rails,
"When you receive a GET request at the URL path `/patients`,
invoke the `index` method specified in the PatientsController class."

## Status Check

We changed a small bit of code, let's see if anything has changed.

-  Navigate to `localhost:3000` in chrome.
-  It looks like our error has changed to:
   ```ruby
    >> uninitialized constant PatientsController
    ```

## Controller

We haven't _defined_ a PatientsController class yet,
so if we try to access `localhost:3000/patients`, we'll get another error:

The purpose of a controller is to handle requests of some particular type.
In this case, we want to create a new controller called `PatientsController`
for responding to requests about a resource called 'Patients'.

Rails has a number of generator tools
for creating boilerplate files very quickly.
To spin up a new controller,
we can just run `rails g controller patients --skip-template-engine`.

*Pay attention to the plural: patients. Plurals are for controllers*

This will automatically create a new file in `app/controllers`
called `patients_controller.rb`, with the following content:

```ruby
class PatientsController < ApplicationController
end
```

Not all controllers handle CRUD,
but those that do tend to follow the following convention for their routes
and controller actions:

| Action  | What It Does                             | HTTP Verb | URL           |
|:-------:|:----------------------------------------:|:---------:|:-------------:|
| index   | Return a list of all resource instances. | GET       | `/patients`     |
| create  | Create a new instance of a resource.     | POST      | `/patients`     |
| show    | Return a single instance of a resource.  | GET       | `/patients/:id` |
| update  | Update a single instance of a resource.  | PATCH     | `/patients/:id` |
| destroy | Destroy a single instance of a resource. | DELETE    | `/patients/:id` |

Let's add an `index` method to `PatientsController`.

```ruby
class PatientsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @patients = Patients.all

    render json: @patients
  end
end
```

## Status Check

Let's navigate to `localhost:3000/patients` and see if our error has changed.

Let's check out server and see if our error message has changed.

It seems we have an `uninitialized constant`! This is because we have yet to
tell rails what a `patient` is, it doesn't know how to **model** the data.

## Model

Let's generate a model by entering `rails g model patient name:string sickness:string age:integer`

-  The g stands for generate, Rails does a lot of work for us.
-  Let's look at what was generated.

## Status Check

Let's navigate to `localhost:3000/patients` and see if our error has changed.

Let's check out server and see if our error message has changed.

It seems we have to migrate, let's do that.

## Migrations

Run `rake db:migrate` in the root of this patients directory.

Let's navigate to `localhost:3000/patients` and see if our error has changed.

We can see what appears to be JSON, but there are no patients! That's because we
have not added any.

## Active Record

First let's enter our `rails console` so we can make use of our models. This
lets us interact with Rails from the command line.

We're going to create a single patient:

### CRUD: C

```ruby
patient1 = Patient.create([{ name: 'Jason Weeks', sickness: 'Too Awesome', age: 27}])
```

and maybe one more...

```ruby
patient2 = Patient.create([{ name: 'Lauren Fazah', sickness: 'Vegetarianism', age: 25}])
```

One extra patient:

```ruby
patient3 = Patient.create([{ name: 'Antony Donovan', sickness: 'Leprosy', age: 41}])

patient4 = Patient.create([{ name: 'Lauren Fazah', sickness: 'Dysentery', age: 23}])
```

We can even use other methods such as `.new` and `.save`.

Now navigate to `localhost:3000/patients` and see if anything has changed.

### CRUD: R

If want to use Active Record for seeing what is in our data store we can do so
by looking for a speific field.

```ruby
Patient.find_by(name: 'Jason Weeks')
# returns the first author

Patient.where(name: 'Lauren Fazah')
# returns all results where author == 'Lauren Fazah'

Patient.last
# returns the last patient in the collection
```

Now navigate to `localhost:3000/patients` and see if anything has changed.

There are more ways to read and organize the data using Active Record. I would
encourge you to look up more in your off time.

### CRUD: U

Let's update one of our patients using Active record

```ruby
patient = Patient.find_by(sickness: 'Vegetarianism')
patient.update(sickness: 'Veganism')

# You could also string this together
Patient.find_by(sickness: 'Veganism').update(sickness: 'Fruitarianism')
```

Now navigate to `localhost:3000/patients` and see if anything has changed.

### CRUD: D

Finally, if we want to remove a patient with Active Record we simply do:

```ruby
Patient.find_by(name: 'Jason Weeks').destroy
```

Now navigate to `localhost:3000/patients` and see if anything has changed.

### What about Curl and Ajax

If we wanted to use Ajax or curl to `create`, `read`, `update` or `destroy` we
will need repeat the process that we used for index.

*Index is one of the (usually) two controller actions that make up `READ` you*
*will need another controller action if you want top show just one item*

### Routing the Rest of CRUD

Remeber how when we first tried to display our JSON on `localhost:3000` we had
to create a route in `config/routes.rb`?

-  This is what in turn triggered the proper controller and controller action.
-  Which in turn interacted with the model
-  Which in turn interacted with the database
-  This cycle then sends information back the way which it came (in this case).

We already did the inital hard work of creating our Patients Controller and our
Patient Model. We tok care of the database too, so all we have left to do is:

1.   Add proper routes which trigger the correct controller/controller action
1.   Add the corresponding controller action

Open `config/routes.rb` and add the following routes below the index route:

```ruby
post '/patients', to: 'patients#create'
# POST request from /patients send to the patients controller, use the create action
get '/patients/:id', to: 'patients#show'
# GET request from /patients send to the patients controller, use the show action
patch '/patients/:id', to: 'patients#update'
delete '/patients/:id', to: 'patients#destroy'

# Note you may see a PUT request out there in the world, for now ignore it.
```

If you run `rake routes` in the root of this directory you can see a list of
all your current routes. *A useful debugging tool*

`:id` is a dynamic segment, it tells rails to expect a piece of information
which goes inside of a *params hash* which will be accessible in the controller.

*Remember how I said Rails does a lot for us*

It's crucial that we use and `:id` dynamic segment otherwise when we make our
show, patch, and delete requests Rails won't know which item in the data store
you're referring to.

Developers often find shortcuts for things they have to do repeatedly. A
shorthand way of writing all the routes listed above is:

```ruby
resources :patients, only: [:index, :show, :create, :update, :destroy]
# I'm a fan of explicit inclusion, but this could also be written:
resources :patients, except: [:new, :edit]
```

We have our routes, now it's time to create the controlled actions that
correspond to those routes.

### Controller CRUD

We can already get a list of all of our patients, but lets write the controller
action that returns a single patient. Add this below your index action:

```ruby
def show
  render json: Patient.find(params[:id])
end
```

Test it out by going to `localhost:3000/patients/1`. Did you see a patient?

Before we go further we should refactor our controller a bit to make it more
secure and DRY.

1. First We're going to set a `before_action` right below where we open up the
`PatientsController` Class with this:

```ruby
before_action :set_patient, only: [:show, :update, :destroy]
```

This will call the `set_patient` method before the `show`, `update`, and `destroy`
actions

Now we have to create the `set_patient` method which will just define the instance
variable `@patient` as the patient that corresponds to the dynamic id you passed in,
in the route:

```ruby
def set_patient
  @patient = Patient.find(params[:id])
end
```

2. Next we want to create a method that will only allow / permit certain keys
(from the key/value pairs being passed in from `create` and `update` requests).

```ruby
def patient_params
  params.require(:patient).permit(:name, :sickness, :age)
end
```

This requires a root key of `patient` and will permit the client to send a title
and author as well. *We could also require name/sickness/age if desired*

Now that we are secure and we can set a single patient, we need to finish our CRUD
actions with `create`, `update` and `delete`

For `create` let's add:

```ruby
def create
  @patient = Patient.new(patient_params)

  if @patient.save
    render json: @patient, status: :created, location: @patient
  else
    render json: @patient.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity
  end
end
```

For `update` let's add:

```ruby
def update
  if @patient.update(patient_params)
    head :no_content
  else
    render json: @patient.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity
  end
end
```

For `destroy` let's add:

```ruby
def destroy
  @patient.destroy

  head :no_content
end
```

One last thing, our helper methods, like `set_patient` and security methods like
`patient_params` shouldn't be public or able to be accessed in any way, so we're
going to make them private by adding this line right before the final `end` that
closes our `patients_controller`:

```ruby
private :set_patient, :patient_params
```

### Status Check

Test your API by writing the curl request to `create`, `update` and `destroy` a
patient.

`create`

```bash
curl --include --request POST http://localhost:3000/patients \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "patient": {
      "name": "Example Title",
      "sickness": "Example Author",
      "age": 99
    }
  }'
```

`show`
```bash
curl --include --request GET http://localhost:3000/patients
```

From these is should not be too difficult to construct an `update` and `destroy`
request.

### A Note on Best Practices

While it is important that you understand how to write a controller and what
each part does as mentioned earlier Rails does a fair amount of work for us.

There is a command that will *generate the model, controller and routes for us.*
It will also create all of the standard crude actions which we wrote by hand.
This command is `rails g scaffold` to create exactly what we wrote you would
type `rails g scaffold patient name:string sickness:string age:integer`

Different developers have different opinions on using scaffolding, some think
it's lazy and would rather be sure about everything they are putting into their
code.  Others think it's the ultimate tool for productivity and prevent bugs,
errors and typos.

*I would recommend using scaffolding.*

### Migrations

What if we've gotten this far and realized that not only do patients have an
`name`, `sickness` and an `age`, but we also want to store some `secret_info`? We don't
have to start from scratch, we just have to change out model and tell it to
update the date store accordingly.  We do this with something called a `migration`.

To add another coloumn to our Patients model called `secret_info`in the root of this
directory all you would have to type is:

```bash
rails g migration AddSecretInfoToPatients secret_info:string
```

The previous command created a migration, which tells the model how to update
the data store.

The following command tells the model to use the migration create and updates
the data session_store

```bash
rake db:migrate
```

Check `localhost:3000/patients`, did anything change?

### Serializers

Let's say that secret info was something that was useful for us, like a password
or SSN or something valuable. We don't want to let anyone who makes a `GET`
request to see that valuable info. That's what serializers are for.

It's easy to think of them as JSON formatters. They control what information can
is sent to the client.

Generate a serializer with `rails g serializer patient`

Check `localhost:3000/patients`, did anything change?

Let's add some attributes that we want to allow the client to see in
`serializers/patient_serializer.rb`

```ruby
attributes :id, :name, :age, :sickness
```
